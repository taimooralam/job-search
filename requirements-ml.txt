# ML/Embedding dependencies
# These are heavy (torch ~200MB CPU, ~3GB with CUDA)
# Only needed for annotation suggestion system (embeddings)
#
# Production: Install with `pip install -r requirements-ml.txt`
# CI/Tests: Skip this - tests mock the ML functionality

sentence-transformers>=2.2.0  # Requires torch, ~80MB model download on first use
