# Pytest configuration for job intelligence pipeline

markers =
    integration: Integration tests that may hit external services or validate quality gates
    unit: Unit tests with mocked dependencies
    slow: Tests that take more than 1 second to run
    quality_gate: Quality gate validation tests for pipeline outputs
    e2e: End-to-end tests that run the full pipeline across multiple phases
