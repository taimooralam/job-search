- first research company and people and their metadata base on firecrawl limitations
- then mine the pain points based on the company information and the people
- the find the opportunity
- then role play a discussion based on JD between the personas of the linkedin profile to generate the ideal candidate they want
- then make them my mentors and hires and let them critique me why I should be a good or bad candidate, and what I am missing.
- Then let me and them generate a CV for myself with the CV reasoning
- Then let them narrate what they would like to read in the outreach letters.
