•	By driving enhancement & modernization of CI/CD, fostered a culture of atomic deployments, for better QA and increased shipping to the market 
•	Anticipated future requirements and challenges and got prepared for them either in plan or in partial execution, strategically while driving refactoring and features
•	drove architectural improvements and initiatives across multiple dimensions with the explicit intention to make the tech stack, state-of-the-art, to reduce onboarding time for new joiners including revamping the architecture, introducing DDD, devolving monoliths into microservices 
•	cultivated, and led by example the culture of incident management and blameless post mortems 
•	attended conferences to maintain professional connections that were needed and gathered knowledge, stay on top of industry trends and distributed this knowledge to the team 
•	maintained the approach of eyes-on hands-off, intervening in a hands on way when required 
•	led the hiring process for software engineers by defining selection criteria, designing interview strategies, and developing technical assessments 
•	maintained a low turn-over by incentivizing developers to grow incl. upgrading to state of the art technologies, and other cultural incentives described above 
•	maximimized team level decisions, heard all voices and opinions, used the principle of people are strongest when they belong at work
