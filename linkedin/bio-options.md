# LinkedIn Bio Options

Generated: 2025-12-06

Based on analysis of master CV, role metadata, and LinkedIn marketing principles.

## Option A: Journey-Focused Professional (~1,900 chars)

**Best for**: Director/Head of Engineering roles at established companies who value both the journey narrative and technical credibility.

```
From building WebRTC recording systems in Pakistan to leading platform transformations at one of Europe's largest media companies — I've spent 11 years understanding systems at every layer.

Currently Technical Lead at Seven.One Entertainment (ProSiebenSat.1), where I transformed a legacy AdTech monolith into event-driven microservices. Results: 75% fewer incidents, zero downtime for 3 years, and the EU's first TCF-compliant consent platform — protecting €30M in annual revenue.

What sets me apart: I've worked at the protocol level (CoAP/OSCOAP at OSRAM, WebRTC at my first startup) and at the organizational level (DDD adoption, multi-year architectural runways). I've shipped event-sourced CQRS to production. I've optimized systems handling billions of events daily.

Career highlights:
→ Enterprise: Platform modernization serving millions of daily ad impressions
→ Startup: 0→1 event-sourced CRM platform with 25 production tenants
→ IoT: Protocol middleware and security features for enterprise lighting
→ Real-time: Video recording systems, multi-party sync, FFmpeg pipelines

Technical depth: TypeScript, Python, Node.js, AWS (Lambda, ECS, EventBridge), DDD, event-driven architecture, observability

Leadership philosophy: I believe the best systems come from teams that understand the "why." I cut our onboarding time from 6 to 3 months through better architecture and ubiquitous language. I've mentored 10+ engineers, 3 now in lead roles.

## Option B: Technical Authority Voice (~1,700 chars)

**Best for**: Staff/Principal Engineer or Tech Lead roles where technical authority matters most.

```
I build systems that don't page you at 3am.

After architecting real-time video systems, IoT protocols, event-sourced platforms, and AdTech infrastructure across 11 years — I've learned that resilience isn't about heroics. It's about boring decisions made early: bounded contexts, observability from day one, and teams who understand the domain.

At Seven.One Entertainment, that approach delivered:
• Zero downtime for 3 consecutive years
• 75% incident reduction during a multi-year platform transformation
• €30M in protected revenue through GDPR/TCF compliance

But I didn't start here. I started reverse-engineering SIP clients at a video conferencing startup in Pakistan. Then CoAP protocol middleware at OSRAM. Then event-sourced CQRS at a startup. Each role taught me something different about how systems fail — and how to prevent it.

What I bring:
→ Protocol-to-platform experience (WebRTC, CoAP, event-driven microservices)
→ 0→1 startup velocity AND enterprise scale
→ DDD, CQRS, event sourcing — in production, not just theory
→ AWS serverless at billions-of-events scale

I mentor engineers on architecture because I've been at every layer of the stack. I cut onboarding time in half because I care about developer experience as much as system performance.

Hiring for someone who's seen both protocol-level debugging and board-level compliance? That's me.

## Option C: Concise & Punchy (~1,200 chars)

**Best for**: Recruiters scanning quickly, or if you prefer brevity — hits all the key points in under 1,200 characters.

```
Engineering leader who's worked at every layer — from WebRTC protocols to €30M compliance systems.

Currently: Technical Lead at Seven.One Entertainment (ProSiebenSat.1), leading a platform transformation that achieved 3 years zero downtime and 75% incident reduction.

Previously: Built event-sourced CRM from scratch (CQRS/NestJS), developed IoT protocol middleware at OSRAM, and created real-time video systems handling multi-party sync.

What I do best:
→ Modernize legacy systems without stopping feature delivery
→ Introduce DDD and observability that actually stick
→ Build teams that ship with confidence (10+ engineers mentored, 3 promoted to lead)

Tech: TypeScript, Python, AWS (Lambda, ECS, EventBridge), DDD, event-driven architecture, microservices

Background: MSc Computer Science from TU Munich. Started career in Pakistan, relocated to Germany. Fluent in English, conversational German.

Let's talk if you're building something that needs both deep technical expertise and leadership experience.

All three options emphasize these unique selling points:

1. **International journey**: Pakistan → Germany via TU Munich
2. **Protocol-level depth**: CoAP, OSCOAP, WebRTC, SIP
3. **Full-stack polyglot**: Not just a backend person
4. **0→1 AND enterprise scale**: Rare combination
5. **Event sourcing in production**: Theory into practice
6. **Quantified impact**: €30M, 75% incident reduction, 3 years zero downtime
7. **Leadership with technical credibility**: Mentored 10+, promoted 3

## What Was Removed (And Why)

| Removed Element | Reason |
|-----------------|--------|
| Skills wall at bottom | Redundant — use LinkedIn Skills section |
| Third-person voice | LinkedIn is social; humans connect with humans |
| Generic title opening | "Engineering Leader" says nothing unique |
| Bullet-point overload | Exhausts readers; prose is more engaging |
| Passive constructions | "Was consulted" → "I build" |

## LinkedIn Profile Optimization Notes

Beyond the bio, consider:

1. **Headline**: Use the 220 characters — e.g., "Technical Lead | Platform Modernization | DDD & Event-Driven Architecture | MSc TU Munich"

2. **Featured section**: Add a project or article about your platform transformation

3. **Experience bullets**: Should align with CV but be more conversational

4. **Skills**: Ensure top 3 pinned skills match your target roles

5. **Recommendations**: Request from colleagues who can speak to leadership + technical depth
