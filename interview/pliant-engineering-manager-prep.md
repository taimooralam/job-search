## 7. Gap Analysis & Mitigation

### Primary Gap: Java/Kotlin + Spring Boot

**The Reality:**
- JD explicitly requires "7+ years with Java/Kotlin and Spring Boot"
- Your experience is TypeScript/JavaScript/Python

**Mitigation Strategy:**

1. **Acknowledge honestly, pivot to transferable skills:**
   > "My primary stack is TypeScript/NestJS, not Java/Kotlin. However, NestJS was designed with Spring Boot patterns in mind—dependency injection, decorators, modular architecture, the onion/hexagonal patterns are nearly identical. The mental models transfer directly."

2. **Emphasize learning velocity:**
   > "When I joined OSRAM, I rapidly ramped up on C++/Qt and CoAP protocols I hadn't used before. At Samdock, I learned EventStore and CQRS patterns deeply in weeks. I'm confident I can achieve proficiency in Kotlin/Spring Boot quickly."

3. **Focus on architecture-level contribution:**
   > "For a 50% hands-on EM role transitioning to leadership, my architectural patterns knowledge—microservices, event-driven, distributed systems—transfers regardless of language. I can contribute meaningfully while ramping up on the syntax."

4. **Show proactive interest:**
   > "I've already started exploring Kotlin's coroutines and Spring Boot 3.x to understand the modern idioms. The JVM ecosystem's maturity for financial systems is impressive."

### Secondary Gap: No explicit B2B Payments/Card Issuing experience

**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize adjacent experience (GDPR compliance, regulated AdTech)
- Show domain learning ability (OpenAIS IoT protocols, real-time video systems)
- Express genuine interest in fintech domain

## 8. Your Introduction (2-3 min)

### Script

> "Thanks for taking the time, Tobias. I'm Taimoor—I'm an Engineering Leader with 11 years of experience, currently Technical Lead at Seven.One Entertainment Group, part of the ProSiebenSat.1 media group.
>
> **What excites me about Pliant** is the combination of building at scale in a regulated environment while having the opportunity to shape engineering culture. At Seven.One, I've spent 5 years transforming a legacy AdTech platform serving millions of daily impressions—going from callback-hell JavaScript to autonomous event-driven TypeScript microservices. We achieved 75% incident reduction and 3 years of zero downtime.
>
> **On the people side**, I've mentored over 10 senior engineers, with 3 progressing to lead positions. I established engineering practices like DDD adoption that cut our onboarding time in half, and created cultural initiatives like 'Lean Friday' that produced breakthrough productivity tools.
>
> **What draws me to this role specifically** is the chance to build a new team from the ground up while still being hands-on. I've done both 0→1 (event-sourced CRM at Samdock) and large-scale transformation—I find the intersection of technical architecture and team leadership the most fulfilling work.
>
> I'm particularly interested in Pliant's API-first approach to B2B payments and how engineering teams here balance velocity with the compliance requirements of being an EMI-licensed institution."

### Key Messages to Land

1. ✅ **Scale experience** - Millions of impressions, enterprise clients
2. ✅ **Transformation track record** - Legacy → modern architecture
3. ✅ **People leadership** - Mentoring, promotions, culture
4. ✅ **Hands-on + strategic** - Architecture AND team building
5. ✅ **Genuine interest** - API-first, regulated fintech

## 9. Expected Questions & Answers

### Q1: "Tell me about yourself and your motivation for joining Pliant"

**Use your introduction above, then add motivation:**

> "Three things draw me to Pliant specifically:
>
> **First**, I'm excited by the technical challenges of payments at scale—card issuance, real-time transaction processing, multi-currency operations. These require the kind of distributed systems thinking I love.
>
> **Second**, Pliant's growth trajectory is compelling. Building a new team during successful scaling means I can shape engineering culture from early stages—that's rare and valuable.
>
> **Third**, the 50% hands-on transitioning to leadership matches exactly where I want to be. I believe the best engineering managers stay technically credible."

---

### Q2: "What are you looking for in your next role?"

> "I'm looking for three things:
>
> **1. Technical depth with leadership impact.** I want to still make architectural decisions while building and growing a team. The 50% hands-on aspect of this role is exactly right.
>
> **2. A product that matters.** B2B payments infrastructure is critical infrastructure for businesses—helping companies optimize their financial operations is meaningful work.
>
> **3. A culture of ownership.** From what I've read about Pliant's values—'Own It,' 'Push It'—it sounds like there's real autonomy and accountability. That's the environment where I do my best work."

---

### Q3: "Tell me about your experience working on backend systems"

**STAR Format:**

> "Let me give you a concrete example from Seven.One.
>
> **Situation:** I inherited a 2015-era JavaScript backend—callback hell, mixed-criticality endpoints where some served millions of consumer requests while others literally affected TV broadcast signals with zero tolerance for failure.
>
> **Task:** Transform this into a maintainable, scalable architecture while continuously shipping features.
>
> **Action:** I designed an event-driven microservices architecture using TypeScript and AWS services—Lambda, ECS, EventBridge for choreography. Rather than big-bang migration, I implemented an Architectural Runway approach: we'd refactor foundational components while continuously delivering features. I moved infrastructure responsibilities out of application code—caching to CloudFront, async orchestration to EventBridge, observability to a dedicated pipeline.
>
> **Result:** 75% incident reduction, 3 years of zero downtime, reduced costs across compute, storage, and complexity. The system now handles our traffic with near-zero maintenance."

---

### Q4: "How do you approach leading and developing engineers?"

> "My philosophy is **'multiplier over hero.'** My job isn't to be the smartest person—it's to make the team better than they'd be without me.
>
> **Practically, this means:**
>
> **1. Creating psychological safety.** At Seven.One, I established blameless postmortems. When we have incidents, we focus on systems, not individuals. This transformed how openly people discussed problems.
>
> **2. Investing in growth.** I mentored 10+ engineers—three of whom I promoted to lead positions. I do this through pairing on hard problems, regular 1:1s focused on career goals, and giving stretch assignments with support.
>
> **3. Building culture, not just process.** I created 'Lean Friday'—one Friday per sprint where anyone can work on any technical improvement. This produced breakthrough tools that increased productivity by orders of magnitude. It also showed the team their ideas matter.
>
> **4. DDD for shared understanding.** I introduced Domain-Driven Design not just as architecture, but as a communication tool. It cut our onboarding time from 6 to 3 months because new engineers could understand the domain through ubiquitous language."

---

### Q5: "Describe a challenging technical decision you made"

> "At Samdock, we were building a CRM platform and I advocated for event sourcing with CQRS—which the team was skeptical about.
>
> **The challenge:** Event sourcing adds complexity. Some team members worried about the learning curve and operational overhead.
>
> **My approach:**
> 1. I led event storming workshops with stakeholders to show how naturally CRM domains map to events (contact created, deal updated, etc.)
> 2. I built a proof-of-concept demonstrating how event replay would give us audit trails and temporal queries for free
> 3. I was transparent about trade-offs: eventual consistency requires careful handling, projection rebuilds need planning
>
> **The result:** We shipped to 25 production tenants. The audit trail became a selling point for enterprise customers. And when we had bugs, being able to replay events to see exactly what happened was invaluable for debugging.
>
> **What I learned:** Technical leadership is about bringing people along. The architecture was right, but getting buy-in through demonstration and transparency was just as important."

---

### Q6: "How do you handle working with product managers and stakeholders?"

> "I view PMs as partners, not requesters. The best outcomes come when we deeply understand each other's constraints.
>
> **At Seven.One, I worked with product owners to translate business OKRs into technical strategy.** When the business goal was increasing ad impressions despite declining linear TV viewership, I developed an algorithmic blacklisting approach that delivered 15% YoY growth against market headwinds.
>
> **I also believe in transparent communication about risk.** I regularly analyze system risks and communicate them honestly to stakeholders—not to create fear, but so they can make informed decisions. For example, explaining that a certain feature timeline might compromise our compliance posture helps PMs prioritize correctly.
>
> **For technical debt, I use Architectural Runway**—a strategic approach where we build foundational improvements alongside feature work. This requires PM partnership, which I gain by demonstrating ROI: 'This refactoring will reduce incidents by X, which costs Y in engineering time.'"

---

### Q7: "What's your experience with Java/Kotlin?" (The Gap Question)

> "I'll be direct: my primary stack is TypeScript with NestJS, not Java/Kotlin. However, I'm confident in my ability to ramp up quickly, and here's why:
>
> **1. The patterns transfer.** NestJS was explicitly designed with Spring Boot patterns in mind—dependency injection, decorators, modular architecture, the onion/hexagonal patterns are nearly identical. When I look at Kotlin + Spring Boot code, the architectural concepts are familiar.
>
> **2. I've ramped up on new stacks before.** At OSRAM, I went from no IoT experience to implementing CoAP protocols and OSCOAP security extensions. At Samdock, I learned EventStore and event sourcing patterns deeply. My learning curve is steep.
>
> **3. For a 50% hands-on role transitioning to leadership,** my value isn't just writing code—it's architectural decisions, team development, and engineering culture. Those skills are language-agnostic.
>
> **4. I'm proactive about it.** I've already started exploring Kotlin's coroutines and Spring Boot 3.x. The JVM ecosystem's maturity for financial systems is impressive, and I'm excited to deepen my knowledge here.
>
> Would you like me to walk through how I approach ramping up on new technologies?"

---

### Q8: "Why are you leaving your current role?"

> "I'm not running from something—I'm running toward something.
>
> Seven.One has been fantastic. I've had 5 years of growth, led a major platform transformation, built an amazing team. I'm proud of what we've accomplished.
>
> **But I'm ready for the next challenge:**
>
> 1. **New domain:** Payments infrastructure is technically fascinating and has real business impact
> 2. **Growth stage company:** Pliant's scaling phase means more opportunity to shape things
> 3. **Building from earlier:** Starting a new team lets me apply everything I've learned about team development from day one
>
> And honestly? The 'Be Pliant' value resonates. After 5 years at an enterprise, I miss the adaptability of smaller, focused teams."

---

### Q9: "How do you balance hands-on work with management responsibilities?"

> "This is something I've actively navigated for 5 years. My approach:
>
> **1. Choose your hands-on carefully.** I don't write code on the critical path where delays would block the team. Instead, I focus on: architectural spikes, tooling improvements, and pairing with engineers on hard problems.
>
> **2. Time-boxing.** I block specific times for technical work and protect them. Mornings for deep work, afternoons for meetings and 1:1s.
>
> **3. Make it teachable.** When I write code, I often pair or do it as a live example. That way the hands-on work doubles as mentoring.
>
> **4. Know when to step back.** As teams mature, I reduce my hands-on involvement. At Seven.One, I went from 60% hands-on initially to maybe 20% now—by design. The sign of good leadership is when your hands-on work decreases because the team is crushing it."
