PHASE 5.1 COMPLETION DETAILS
============================

Status: COMPLETE AND TESTED
Completion Date: 2025-11-28
Duration: 8-10 hours
Git Commit: c81c1ff4 (feat(cv-editor): Implement Phase 5.1 WYSIWYG page break visualization)

  * Basic page break scenarios: 4 tests
  * Page size support (Letter/A4): 6 tests
  * Margin variations: 5 tests
  * Content type handling: 4 tests
  * Edge cases: 4 tests
  * Position accuracy: 5 tests
  * Real-world scenarios: 4 tests

IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
====================
Comprehensive implementation report available at:
reports/PHASE5_1_IMPLEMENTATION_2025-11-28.md

This report documents:
- Feature specifications
- Test categories and results
- New module details
- Integration approach
- Performance metrics
- Timeline and effort estimate

NEXT PHASES
===========

Phase 5.2 (NOT STARTED - Ready to Begin)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+B, Ctrl+I, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+S)
- Version history / undo-redo enhancements
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Accessibility improvements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- E2E test re-enablement
- Estimated: 12-18 hours

Phase 6 (PLANNED - Can Run in Parallel)
- PDF service separation into dedicated Docker container
- Independent scaling for PDF generation
- Foundation for multi-document types (cover letter, dossier)
- Estimated: 4-6 hours
- Plan document: plans/phase6-pdf-service-separation.md

DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION
===========================

[x] Phase 5.1 moved from gaps to completed
[x] Test counts updated correctly (220 unit, 260 with integration)
[x] Git commit referenced (c81c1ff4)
[x] Implementation report linked
[x] Technical details accurate
[x] Success criteria verified
[x] No orphaned TODO items
[x] Dates consistent across files
[x] Phase 5.2 status clear (not started)
[x] Phase 6 status clear (planned)

SYSTEM STABILITY
================

- No breaking changes introduced
- All existing tests still passing (188 Phase 1-4 tests)
- New tests fully isolated (32 Phase 5.1 tests)
- Combined test suite: 220 unit tests passing
- Performance: Negligible impact from page break visualization
- PDF export still working correctly (tested separately)

AGENT RECOMMENDATION
====================

Documentation sync complete.

Next priority for implementation:
- Frontend-Developer: Begin Phase 5.2 (Keyboard Shortcuts + Version History)
  Estimated time: 12-18 hours
  Can proceed immediately

Alternative priority:
- Architecture-Debugger: Begin Phase 6 (PDF Service Separation)
  Estimated time: 4-6 hours
  Can run in parallel with Phase 5.2
