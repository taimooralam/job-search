# LinkedIn Outreach Update - 2025-11-27

## Change Made

Updated Layer 6 outreach generator to include the signature "Best. Taimoor Alam" after the Calendly URL in LinkedIn messages.

## File Modified

**File**: `/Users/ala0001t/pers/projects/job-search/src/layer6/outreach_generator.py`

**Line 224**: Updated closing line format

### Before
```python
closing = f"I have applied for this role. Calendly: {self.candidate_calendly}"
```

### After
```python
closing = f"I have applied for this role. Calendly: {self.candidate_calendly}\nBest. Taimoor Alam"
```

## Result

All LinkedIn outreach messages generated by Layer 6 will now automatically include the signature "Best. Taimoor Alam" after the Calendly URL:

```
I have applied for this role. Calendly: https://calendly.com/taimooralam/15min
Best. Taimoor Alam
```

## Character Limit Compliance

- Connection requests: 300 characters max (LinkedIn enforces)
- InMail messages: 1900 characters max (LinkedIn enforces)
- The signature "Best. Taimoor Alam" is included in character count

## Verification

To verify the change works:
1. Generate an outreach message using Layer 6
2. Check that LinkedIn message includes the signature after the Calendly URL
3. Verify character count stays within limits
