## Core Value Proposition

### Meta-Differentiator: Bird's-Eye-to-Specifics Thinking

**What it is:** The rare ability to fluidly move between high-level system visualization and granular implementation details—and communicate both to any audience (business or technical).

**Why it matters:** Most engineers are either "big picture strategists" OR "detail-oriented implementers." This candidate operates at both levels simultaneously, enabling:
- Multi-dimensional problem diagnosis (seeing how code, architecture, infra, process, and cost interconnect)
- Effective stakeholder communication (Miro diagrams that explain systems to business AND technical audiences)
- Architecture decisions grounded in implementation reality
- Leadership that doesn't lose touch with technical depth

**Evidence across achievements:**
- Achievement 1 (Seven.One): Diagnosed monolith problems across 5+ dimensions simultaneously
- *(More evidence to be added as we review achievements)*

**Best for roles:** Staff SWE, Principal SWE, Software Architect, Head of Eng, Director, CTO

## Differentiators by Theme

### Theme 1: Infrastructure-First Mindset

Move responsibilities to the infrastructure layer where they belong, rather than building application-level workarounds.

| Source | Differentiator | Best For |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| Seven.One #1 | Moved caching (Redis→CloudFront), log aggregation (app→pipeline), orchestration (frontend→EventBridge) to infra | Architect, Staff+, CTO |

### Theme 2: Ownership When Others Accept Status Quo

Values-driven initiative to improve systems that others avoid ("don't touch it"). Finds meaning in building state-of-the-art systems.

| Source | Differentiator | Best For |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| Seven.One #1 | Took ownership of neglected legacy system when others wouldn't disturb "working" (buggy) solutions | All roles (character trait) |

### Theme 3: Multi-Dimensional Cost Thinking

Sees cost reduction not as a single metric but across multiple dimensions: people, knowledge, tech, compute, storage, complexity.

| Source | Differentiator | Best For |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| Seven.One #1 | Platform transformation reduced costs across 6 dimensions simultaneously | Head of Eng+, Director, CTO |

## Individual Differentiators

### Seven.One Entertainment (2020–Present)

#### Achievement 1: Legacy Modernization & Platform Transformation

**Differentiator 1: Multi-Dimensional System Diagnosis**
- **What:** Ability to see problems across code, architecture, infrastructure, process, and cost simultaneously
- **Evidence:** Monolith had callback hell (code), mixed-criticality endpoints (architecture), app-level log aggregation (responsibility boundaries), frontend orchestration (process anti-pattern), Redis vs CloudFront (cost inefficiency)—diagnosed as one interconnected problem
- **Best for:** Staff+, Principal, Software Architect, Head of Eng+, CTO
- **Interview hook:** "The monolith wasn't just bad code—it was bad architecture, bad responsibility boundaries, AND bad process patterns. I saw them as interconnected and addressed root causes."

**Differentiator 2: Infrastructure-First Mindset**
- **What:** Instinct to move responsibilities to infrastructure layer where they belong
- **Evidence:** Caching from Redis (code) → CloudFront (infra); log aggregation from app → observability pipeline; async orchestration from frontend → EventBridge
- **Best for:** Software Architect, Staff+, Principal, CTO
- **Interview hook:** "I kept asking: why is this in application code? This belongs at the infrastructure level."

**Differentiator 3: Values-Driven Ownership**
- **What:** Takes initiative to improve systems others avoid, driven by personal values
- **Evidence:** "Others tended to just not disturb a working solution even if it was buggy. My values made me think I owe the company something better."
- **Best for:** All roles—character differentiator
- **Interview hook:** "I found meaning in building a state-of-the-art system that reduced costs across every dimension."
