Change the master CV to create an updated and tailored ATS ready CV that suits and matches the job description.

Use dossier.txt -> the Job description, the pain-point analysis, company research and opportunity mapper create a tailored CV for me with the following steps (write the CV in cv.md). Keep bullets crisp (15–25 words), start each with a strong verb, include a clear metric/result, and tie to a provided pain point or success metric. Do not add STAR labels or invent facts. If data is missing, state it plainly.

1. Analyse the title, job description, give a reasoning of which categories does the job description fall into, if there is a weighted overlap also mention it.
   Category 1: Senior, Lead, Staff or Principal Engineer
   Category 2: Engineering Manager, Team Lead or Engineering Lead
   Category 3: Head of Engineering or Head of Technology
   Category 4: Director of Software Engineering, Director of Software Development
   Category 5: CTO

2. Use the pain points, company, research and opportunity mapper to create a CV with the following rules
   Right after the name: add the title on the CV title based on the closed title of the job description role and supplement that with an Engineering Leadership title if it is category 2-4 or a Tech Lead if it is category 1. Add overarching skills that are required for the job such as cloud, architecture, software engineering, AI etc.

3. Header and title section: START with a header and title section just like the master resume with name, phone number, email id and location. Use the title of the Job description as my title and then use a generic title that is the umbrella term of that job e.g. Engineering Leader. Then use the 3 to 4 core overarching skills e.g. Managing Teams, Cloud, Large Scale Distrubuted System, DDD, Leading Large Scale High Performing Teams.

4. In the subtext (as subtext in markdown) of header section, mention by nationality, languages spoken, linkedin profile and education.

5. Profile Section: The create a profile section and mention in bullet points describing who I am, what I do directly with the purpose of how it fits into the job description and pain points and how will it be beneficial for the company. The purpose of this section is that if a human looks at it, it seems so close to what they are looking for they are bound to give me an interview opportunity. It also uses the same terminology as the CV itself.

6. Then comes the Core Skills section. Based on the inputs above and the requirements and determine 4 broad categorization of skills that are needed for the job, including Hard and soft skills. Include the Hard and soft skills from my master resume that are mentioned at the end of every work experience section and pick the best, most relevant, most tailored and ATS friendly ones in this core skills section. Use the higher priority category and skills first according to the JD. Use both Hard and Soft Kills that are deeply technical. Create nuance of this when doing an IC role vs a leadership role.

7. In the work experience section, mention all the bullet points as in the master resume with the title, company name and duration. Proritize them based on the category of the job. Use the STAR metholology to write the bullet points in a way that they are the most relevant to the job at hand in order of priority, use the Job description's terminology and are ATS friendly. Furthermore that they directly address the pain-points and opportunity mapper from above.

8. In the older experience sections such as the the work at KI Labs, FORTISS and before that, include all the bullet points mentioned and technical details. Only change slightly towards the job category. These were early stage career roles and have to stay as they are.

9. Do not hallucinate, you are allowed to make the STARs 10% more impactful than they actually are, but do not generate facts, do not assume anything and do not try to fit everything to the job description. There might be gaps between my CV and the resume, I want to reduce the gap but by not altering facts and going as close as possible without hallunicating.

10. At the end double check the resume again, did you hallcinate or fabricate facts, add that to reasoning.md

11. When tailoring towards the category remember that that category overall get's more weightage do not completely eliminate all the other categories, keep the tech details even though it is management role to show that I am technically hands on and can have deep conversations with people about them.
