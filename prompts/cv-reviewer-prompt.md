Opus got the following prompt in quotes and it produced master CV.md

"Based on the master-cv.md, the Job description, the pain-point analysis, company research and opportunity mapper create a tailored CV for me with the following steps:

1. Analyse the title, job description, give a reasoning of which categories does the job description fall into, if there is a weighted overlap also mention it.
Category 1: Senior, Lead, Staff or Principal Engineer
Category 2: Engineering Manager, Team Lead or Engineering Lead
Category 3: Head of Engineering or Head of Technology
Category 4: Director of Software Engineering, Director of Software Development
Category 5: CTO

2. Use the pain points, company, research and opportunity mapper to create a CV with the following rules
A. Add the my current title based on the closed title of the job description role and supplement that with an Engineering Leadership title if it is category 2-4 or a Tech Lead if it is category 1.

3. Mention my nationality, and the languages I speak and my linkedin profile. Also mention my education. If it is a job based in a non-EU country espacially the Middle East mention relocation in 2 months.

4. The create a profile section and mention the bullet points describing who I am, what I do directly with the purpose of how it fits into the job description and pain points and how will it be beneficial for the company. The purpose of this section is that if a human looks at it, it seems so close to what they are looking for they are bound to give me an interview opportunity. It also uses the same terminology as the CV itself.

5. Then comes the Core Skills section. Based on the inputs above and the requirements and determine 4 broad categorization of skills that are needed for the job, including Hard and soft skills. Include the Hard and soft skills from my master resume that are mentioned at the end of every work experience section and pick the best, most relevant, most tailored and ATS friendly ones in this core skills section. Use the higher priority category and skills first according to the JD.

6. In the work experience section, mention all my jobs as in the master resume with the title, company name and duration. However reduce/compact the number of bullet points as follows. In the two most recent roles write 7 to 10 points based from the master resume that is either a compacting of one points for the experience section or many. Use the STAR metholology to write the bullet points in a way that they are the most relevant to the job at hand in order of priority, use the Job description's terminology and are ATS friendly. Furthermore that they directly address the pain-points and opportunity mapper from above. They are short and not more than 20 words each preferably 12-18 words and are crisp and professional and directly address what the job description is looking for.

7. Do not hallucinate, you are allowed to make the STARs 10% more impactful than they actually are, but do not generate facts, do not assume anything and do not try to fit everything to the job description. There might be gaps between my CV and the resume, I want to reduce the gap but by not altering facts and going as close as possible without hallunicating.


8. At the end double check the resume again, did you hallcinate or fabricate facts, add that to reasoning.md"

Read all of those files and analyse whether the CV generated fulfills the criteria. Add the analysis to feedback.md. Also suggest improvements and mitigation to fit the CV better.
