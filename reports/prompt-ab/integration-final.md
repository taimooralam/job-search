## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of running the enhanced prompts against actual LLM
endpoints using the A/B testing scoring framework.

### Overall Results

| Layer | Specificity | Grounding | Hallucinations | Combined | Status |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|----------|--------|
| layer4 | 6.8 | 7.2 | 10.0 | 7.9 | NEEDS WORK |
| layer6a | 7.8 | 8.9 | 8.5 | 8.4 | NEEDS WORK |
| layer6b | 6.5 | 5.8 | 10.0 | 7.3 | NEEDS WORK |

### Target Thresholds

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Specificity | 7.0+ | Less generic, more concrete |
| Grounding | 8.0+ | Evidence-based claims |
| Hallucinations | 9.0+ | No fabricated info |
| Combined | 7.5+ | Overall quality |

## Recommendations

### Iteration Required

Some layers do not meet all target thresholds. Review the detailed results above
and iterate on the prompts that need improvement.

**Layers Requiring Attention**:
- **layer4**: Improve specificity, grounding
- **layer6a**: Improve hallucinations
- **layer6b**: Improve specificity, grounding, combined

**Iteration Strategy**:
1. Focus on layers with lowest scores first
2. Review prompt techniques from `thoughts/*.md`
3. Re-run integration tests after changes
4. Maximum 3 iterations per layer
