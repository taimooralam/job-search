## Design Notes

Per the CV generation critique recommendations:
- Using **variant selection** instead of pure generation
- Each achievement has multiple emphasis variants for JD matching
- Allowing **format diversity** (not forcing ARIS on everything)
- **Consulting/client work** context is key differentiator
- All variants are **interview-defensible**
