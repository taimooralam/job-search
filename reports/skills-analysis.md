These are keywords to add for **better section ranking** when matching JD keywords.

#### High Priority (appear in 4+ roles)

| Keyword | Roles Using It | Action |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| `distributed systems` | 7 | **ADD to all management roles** |
| `api design` | 5 | **ADD to all roles** |
| `javascript` | 5 | ADD to tech-heavy roles |

| `postgresql` | 4 | ADD to Backend sections |
| `gcp` | 4 | Already in some roles ✓ |

#### Medium Priority (appear in 2-3 roles)

```
c++, event-driven architecture, rest apis, sql, microservices,
cloud infrastructure, infrastructure as code, kafka, linux, rust,
c#, data pipelines, cloud architecture, software architecture,
azure, kubernetes
```

### 2. For `role_metadata.json` → `hard_skills` (Whitelist)

**⚠️ Only add skills you have EVIDENCE for in your Achievement MDs!**

#### Technical Skills to Consider Adding

| Skill | Check Evidence In |
|-------|-------------------|
| `distributed systems` | Seven.One (event-driven, high throughput) |
| `api design` | KI Labs (REST API), Samdock (OpenAPI/Swagger) |
| `docker` | All roles (containerization mentioned) |
| `kafka` | Need to verify in Achievement MDs |
| `java` | Need to verify in Achievement MDs |
| `postgresql` | Need to verify in Achievement MDs |
| `gcp` | Samdock role (GCP mentioned) |
| `data pipelines` | KI Labs (large-scale data pipeline) |
| `go/golang` | Need to verify in Achievement MDs |
| `c++` | OSRAM role (C++ mentioned) |
| `redis` | Seven.One (caching layer) |
| `observability` | Seven.One (OpenSearch, dashboards) |
| `performance optimization` | Seven.One (low latency) |

### 3. For `role_metadata.json` → `soft_skills` (Whitelist)

**⚠️ Only add skills you have EVIDENCE for in your Achievement MDs!**

#### Soft Skills to Consider Adding

| Skill | Check Evidence In |
|-------|-------------------|
| `communication` | All leadership roles (stakeholder communication) |
| `leadership` | Seven.One, Samdock (team leadership) |
| `coaching` | Seven.One (1:1s, career pathing) |
| `accountability` | Postmortems, OKRs |
| `adaptability` | Multiple tech stack changes |
| `decision making` | Architecture decisions |

## Quick Reference: Files to Update

| File | Section | What to Add |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `role_skills_taxonomy.json` | `jd_signals` arrays | High-frequency keywords from jobs |
| `role_metadata.json` | `hard_skills` arrays per role | Technical skills with evidence |
| `role_metadata.json` | `soft_skills` arrays per role | Soft skills with evidence |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review Achievement MDs** to verify which skills have concrete evidence
2. **Add verified skills** to `hard_skills` and `soft_skills` in `role_metadata.json`
3. **Add high-frequency keywords** to `jd_signals` in `role_skills_taxonomy.json`
4. **Re-run CV generation** to test improved matching
