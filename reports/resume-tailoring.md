# Tailoring Guidance for Senior Engineering Leadership Roles

## How to Use
- Keep a master resume (below) and create targeted variants per role.
- Lead with a crisp 3–4 line summary tuned to the exact title.
- Front-load 4–6 bullets of evidence (scope, decisions, outcomes, metrics) that match the JD.
- Reorder achievements per role; swap keywords/tech to mirror JD language without exaggeration.
- Quantify everything; keep recent wins (≤4 years) most prominent.

## Per-Role Tailoring

### Engineering Manager
- Position profile as “people-first EM modernizing distributed systems”; note team size, hiring, coaching, performance management, career ladders.
- First bullets: incident reduction (75%), onboarding cut (6→3 months), promotions (3 engineers to lead), velocity/flow metrics (25% faster delivery, MTTR −60%).
- Add process focus: blameless postmortems, architecture governance, predictable delivery (release cycle weeks→days), cross-functional OKR alignment.
- Emphasize stakeholder/results lines: €30M revenue protection (GDPR/TCF), 15% YoY impression growth.
- Skills section: add “hiring plans, org design, succession planning, roadmap prioritization, budget/capacity planning.”

### Lead / Staff Software Engineer
- Lead: showcase hands-on ownership and technical leadership of microservices/observability pipelines; keep team scope (8–10 engineers) secondary.
- Staff: emphasize systems-level influence—DDD bounded contexts, choreography vs orchestration tradeoffs, AWS autoscaling efficiency (10× cost down), reducing missed impressions by 20%.
- Both: highlight design docs, standards (API/Swagger, testing frameworks, reusable components), and mentoring outcomes (apprentice → mid-level).
- Place AI/agentic work and real-time observability prominently; use “designed, drove, shipped” verbs; include interoperability work (GDPR compliance, partner integrations).
- Keywords to mirror JD: “technical lead, design reviews, production readiness, incident commander, RFCs, SLOs, operational excellence.”

### Principal Software Engineer
- Lead with org-wide architecture impact: monolith→event-driven migration, DDD language adoption, governance programs.
- Spotlight cross-team influence: matrixed alignment, defining north-star architecture, keeping zero downtime for 3 years while shipping.
- Stress decision-making and risk management: consent platform audits passed, cost/perf tradeoffs, impression growth during market decline.
- Add “build vs buy” and “platformization” narratives; quantify benefits (75% incident drop, onboarding −50%, velocity +25%).
- Include enterprise-scale keywords: “multi-tenant, contract testing, backward compatibility, change management, SLA/SLO design.”

### Software / Enterprise Architect
- Title the summary “Software & Enterprise Architect | Event-Driven + DDD + Cloud” and add architecture governance upfront.
- Lead bullets: bounded contexts, CQRS/EventSourcing, choreography patterns, observability pipeline at billions/day, API standards (Swagger), message contracts, reference architectures.
- Show compliance and risk: GDPR/TCF consent platform, audits passed, €30M risk mitigated, security additions (OSCOAP, JWT).
- Add artifacts: decision records, architecture runway, capability maps, integration playbooks, cost models.
- Keywords: “capability mapping, domain cartography, integration strategy, platform boundaries, non-functional requirements, SLO mapping, threat modeling.”

### Head of Engineering
- Summary: “Head of Engineering scaling teams and modernizing platforms; zero-downtime delivery; 5+ years leading cross-functional orgs.”
- Front-load org outcomes: reduced onboarding 6→3 months, velocity +25%, release cadence weeks→days, 3 promotions to leads, 10× cost reduction.
- Emphasize operating model: OKR alignment, delivery predictability, talent development, hiring plans, resource allocation, vendor/partner management.
- Include business outcomes: 15% YoY impression growth, €30M revenue protection, 20% fewer missed impressions.
- Mention governance: postmortems, quality gates, architecture councils, SLA/SLO policy; add budget/capacity planning.

### Director of Engineering
- Reframe scope to multi-team portfolio leadership; explicitly mention number of teams, budgets, and cross-org dependencies.
- Lead bullets: multi-year transformation roadmap ownership, change management, scaling across matrixed teams; delivery predictability +25%.
- Highlight compliance/regulatory and risk controls; note cost efficiency (10× reduction) and operational resilience (zero downtime).
- Add “exec reporting cadence, program management with OKRs/KPIs, vendor selection, hiring bar calibration, succession planning.”
- Keep technical credibility via brief architecture wins (event-driven migration, observability) but keep focus on execution and org health.

### CTO
- Open with business/technology bridge: “CTO driving product acceleration, platform modernization, and regulatory resilience.”
- Elevate strategy: market-aware roadmap, AI/platform bets, build/buy/partner decisions, multi-year architecture vision.
- Quantify business protection/growth: €30M revenue safeguarded, 15% impression growth in declining market, 10× cost efficiency.
- Show org-building: scaling teams from startup→enterprise, onboarding halved, leadership bench growth, culture of blameless learning.
- Add governance and risk: security/compliance milestones, SLOs, audit readiness; mention board/exec communication and KPI storytelling.
- Keep a short “technical edge” line: agentic AI, event-driven microservices, observability at billions/day, cloud spend optimization.

## Section Reordering by Role
- Management-heavy roles (EM, Head, Director, CTO): summary → leadership highlights → org/process wins → architecture/tech depth → core skills (leadership first) → experience.
- IC-heavy roles (Lead/Staff/Principal, Architect): summary → architecture/system wins → scale/tech stack → leadership/mentoring → selected metrics → experience.
- Move the Seven.One role first (already current). Reorder bullets within each role to match the target title’s priorities above.

## Keywords to Thread In (match JD wording)
- Leadership: “org design, hiring, performance management, coaching, stakeholder alignment, budget/capacity planning, delivery predictability.”
- Architecture/Scale: “event-driven microservices, choreography, CQRS/ES, DDD/bounded contexts, SLOs/SLAs, observability, multi-tenant, backward compatibility, cost optimization.”
- Compliance/Reliability: “GDPR/TCF, audit readiness, incident command, RCAs, change management.”
- AI/Innovation: “agentic AI, real-time decisioning, data products, experimentation platforms.”

## Quick Edits to Make Globally
- Add team counts and budget/portfolio scope where possible (e.g., “led 3 squads / 10 engineers,” “managed €X cloud spend optimizations”).
- Add bullets showing executive communication: “quarterly architecture reviews with CPO/CFO,” “risk briefings.”
- Mention build/run ownership: “end-to-end delivery and production operations; SLO/SLA ownership.”
- Keep metrics tight: percent change + business impact; ensure consistency in verb tense (present for current role, past for previous).
