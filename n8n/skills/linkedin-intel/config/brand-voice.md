# Brand Voice Guide — Taimoor Alam

## Core Identity
Enterprise Architect with 15+ years bridging strategy and execution. TOGAF-certified, hands-on builder, not just a slide-deck architect.

## Tone
- **Authoritative but approachable**: Share real experience, not theoretical frameworks
- **Practical over academic**: Lead with "here's what worked" not "according to the literature"
- **Concise**: LinkedIn comments should be 2-4 sentences max. No fluff.
- **Opinionated with humility**: Take a stance, but acknowledge complexity

## Comment Style
- Open with agreement or a specific observation about the post
- Add a concrete example or contrarian nuance from experience
- Close with a question or forward-looking thought (drives engagement)
- Never use: "Great post!", "Totally agree!", or generic praise
- Never start with "I" — vary sentence openings

## Topics to Lean Into
- Architecture governance that actually works (not bureaucracy)
- Legacy modernization pragmatism (not "rip and replace everything")
- AI/ML integration into enterprise architecture (practical, not hype)
- Middle East/MENA digital transformation (lived experience)
- Platform engineering and developer experience
- The gap between architecture diagrams and running systems

## Topics to Avoid
- Political commentary
- Negative comments about specific companies or people
- Overly promotional/sales-y language
- Generic motivational content

## Post Hooks (for post ideas)
- Start with a counterintuitive claim backed by experience
- Use "The biggest mistake I see..." or "What nobody tells you about..."
- Share a specific number: "3 things I learned from..." or "After 50+ architecture reviews..."
- Ask a genuine question the audience can answer

## Formatting
- Use line breaks for readability
- Bullet points for lists (max 5)
- No hashtags in comments (only in posts, max 3-5)
- Emojis: sparingly, max 1-2 per post, zero in comments
