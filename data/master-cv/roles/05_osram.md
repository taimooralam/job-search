## Metrics Note

Per critique guidance on **qualitative specificity over manufactured metrics**:
- ❌ Avoid: "Reduced latency by 25%" (unverifiable without source)
- ✅ Use: "Extensively used for business demonstrations" (defensible)
- ✅ Use: "Served as template for other projects" (factual team adoption)
- ✅ Use: "Reducing support requests by ~30%" (approximate, defensible)

The ~30% support reduction is noted in original data and should only be used if defensible in interview.
