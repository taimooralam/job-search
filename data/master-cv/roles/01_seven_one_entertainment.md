**Location**: Munich, DE
**Period**: 2020–Present
**Is Current**: true

## Achievements

• Led multi-year transformation of large-scale monolithic AdTech platform processing millions of impressions daily into choreographed event-driven microservices in AWS, achieving 75% incident reduction and zero downtime for 3 years while maintaining feature delivery
• devised a technical vision and roadmap, aligning with company strategy of increasing reach and consented users, preserved and increased ad impressions despite global industry wide decline in linear TV viewership
• designed and implemented an Architectural Runway to simultaneously address extensive technical debt and accelerate feature development. Successfully executed a strategic, incremental multi-year roadmap, achieving ~70% refactoring of complex large scale distributed system components while continuously delivering business-critical features, balancing quality with speed of shipping
• enhanced system architecture & reduced technical debt by mentoring engineers about the DDD framework to standardize best practices for coding & design. Inspired decoupled modules using event-based systems, strategically moving to thin front-end client and towards business-logic-heavy, autonomous & choregraphed backend microservices deployed on AWS. This led to architectural flexibility, maintainability, scalability, resilience and cost optimization. Used TDD and BDD to keep the quality of the code base top-notch.
• Led the initiative to plan, architect and realize the much-needed data and observability pipeline to channel millions of data points to opensearch. The real-time dashboards, helped uncover issues and debug scenarios that would otherwise not have been possible, thereby increasing shipping speed, resolving issues faster and ultimately increasing a significant amount of revenue
• Led and optimized the scaling of multi-million user backend systems around bursty traffic, used agentic AI to expedite this process
• Was seen and consulted as the subject matter experts on the technical challenges and possibilities in the Addressable TV domain.
• Managed and scaled delivery across matrixed cross-functional engineering teams, implementing Domain-Driven Design principles that reduced developer onboarding from 6 to 3 months and improved team velocity by 25%
• Architected real-time data observability pipeline processing billions of events daily using OpenSearch and AWS, reducing operational costs by 10x and enabling data-driven decision making across engineering teams
• Drove technical strategy aligning architecture roadmap with business OKRs, resulting in 15% YoY impression growth despite declining linear TV market through improved ad supply optimization
• Established engineering excellence standards including blameless postmortems, automated testing frameworks, and architecture governance that improved delivery predictability by 25% and reduced release cycles from weeks to days
• Led GDPR/TCF compliance program across multiple product lines, implementing consent management platform that passed BLM regulatory audits and protected €30M annual revenue exposure
• Introduced ubiquitous language and bounded contexts through DDD, enabling consistent business-tech communication and reducing requirement misalignment by 40%
• Scaled AWS infrastructure for bursty traffic patterns using Lambda and ECS auto-scaling, optimizing cost-performance balance and reducing missed impressions by 20%
• Mentored 10+ senior engineers on architectural patterns, event-driven design, and cloud best practices, promoting 3 engineers to lead positions
• Implemented comprehensive monitoring and alerting system that reduced MTTR by 60% through proactive incident detection and automated response workflows
• Collaborated with product owners, enterprise architects and other stakeholders in the organization to identify core business metrics, and led their realization across the technical stack
• Analysed the risks to the system and communicated them transparently to all business stakeholders to have them well-informed about the consequences of future business decisions.
• Brainstormed, developed and led initiative to realize value innovation such as adaptive blacklisting to ~20% reach and revenue
• Collaborated a with business stakeholders to break complex projects down into technical requirements, decide what would be an MVP and lead, development and deployment incrementally to balance speed vs quality
• Took hard decisions despite ambiguity, executed quickly and collected data to adapt and iterate
• Cultivated a culture of innovation in the teams by establishing the process of Lean Friday: One Friday every sprint where the team would work on any technical improvement topic they wanted: this resulted in breakthrough tools that resulted in quicker development, QA and business processes increasing team productivity by orders of magnitude
• Cultivated a culture of knowledge sharing, onboarding, mentoring engineers with kindness and patience and creating a ripple affect culture across the whole department.
• By driving enhancement & modernization of CI/CD, fostered a culture of atomic deployments, for better QA and increased shipping to the market
• Anticipated future requirements and challenges and got prepared for them either in plan or in partial execution, strategically while driving refactoring and features
• drove architectural improvements and initiatives across multiple dimensions with the explicit intention to make the tech stack, state-of-the-art, to reduce onboarding time for new joiners including revamping the architecture, introducing DDD, devolving monoliths into microservices
• cultivated, and led by example the culture of incident management and blameless post mortems
• attended conferences to maintain professional connections that were needed and gathered knowledge, stay on top of industry trends and distributed this knowledge to the team
• maintained the approach of eyes-on hands-off, intervening in a hands on way when required
• led the hiring process for software engineers by defining selection criteria, designing interview strategies, and developing technical assessments
• maintained a low turn-over by incentivizing developers to grow incl. upgrading to state of the art technologies, and other cultural incentives described above
• maximimized team level decisions, heard all voices and opinions, used the principle of people are strongest when they belong at work
• led multiple successful GDPR related CMP audits by the Bavarian Media Regulatory Authority BLM, and created a professional relationship of good faith
• preserved 30M euro revenue by designing and leading the development of a TCF GDPR approved compliant CMP, and became the first movers to do so in the EU region.
